v0_who_global_map_age_std,Global suicide rate map,WHO Global,Choropleth map,Map global variation in age standardized suicide rates,The legend spans roughly 5 to 35 per 100k and the map shows a wide gradient across countries. High values appear in a limited set of countries while many remain in the low to mid range,Choropleth maps reveal geographic disparities clearly,Suicide burden is uneven with identifiable hotspots,v0_who_global_map_age_std.png,html/v0_who_global_map_age_std.html,1
v0_who_scatter_crude_vs_age_std,Crude vs age standardized rates,WHO Global,Scatter + trend,Compare crude and age standardized rates for ranking shifts,Points follow a clear positive slope between crude and age standardized rates. Several countries sit far above or below the trend which indicates that age structure can shift standardized rankings,Scatter plots show correlation and outliers simultaneously,Age structure can change how countries rank,v0_who_scatter_crude_vs_age_std.png,html/v0_who_scatter_crude_vs_age_std.html,2
v0_who_region_violin_age_std,Regional distribution by sex,WHO Regions,Violin,Compare regional distributions of age standardized rates by sex,Male distributions are consistently higher than female across regions with visibly wider tails. Regional spreads vary with some regions showing long upper tails and higher medians,Violin plots expose distribution shape beyond averages,Regional variability differs for men and women,v0_who_region_violin_age_std.png,html/v0_who_region_violin_age_std.html,3
v0_gbd_depression_dalys_top10,Top depression DALYs by age,GBD Depression DALYs,Ranked bar,Identify age groups with the highest depression DALYs burden,Each age panel has a distinct top 10 list and the ordering differs by age group. Older age groups show the highest values with bars reaching the upper end of the scale,Ranked bars make ordering and magnitude easy to compare,Depression burden concentrates in older ages,v0_gbd_depression_dalys_top10.png,html/v0_gbd_depression_dalys_top10.html,4
v0_gbd_mental_deaths_small_multiples,Mental and substance deaths by cause,GBD Mental & Substance Deaths,Small multiples,Compare cause specific death rates across sexes on a common scale,Across causes the male bars are generally higher than female bars and the gap is more visible in self harm and alcohol panels. Country rankings shift by cause which implies distinct burden profiles,Small multiples preserve comparability across many series,Cause patterns differ by sex,v0_gbd_mental_deaths_small_multiples.png,html/v0_gbd_mental_deaths_small_multiples.html,5
v0_gbd_age_standardized_heatmap,Global age standardized rates matrix,GBD Age-Standardized Death Rate,Heatmap,Scan cause by sex patterns in age standardized death rates,Non communicable diseases dominate the matrix for both sexes with the highest intensities. Mental and substance rows stay near the low end while injuries and communicable causes sit in the middle range,Heatmaps handle dense matrices efficiently,Some causes are strongly sex skewed,v0_gbd_age_standardized_heatmap.png,html/v0_gbd_age_standardized_heatmap.html,6
v0_gbd_allcause_animated_trend,All cause burden over time,GBD All-Cause Trends,Facet line,Compare all cause deaths over time across metrics and sex,Numbers and rates both decline from 2021 to 2023 with both sexes highest and male above female. The rate panel shows a steeper drop than the count panel,Faceted lines allow metric comparison without animation,Counts and rates fall over time while sex gaps persist,v0_gbd_allcause_animated_trend.png,html/v0_gbd_allcause_animated_trend.html,7
v0_gbd_probability_of_death_map,Probability of death map,GBD Probability of Death,Choropleth map,Map probability of death for self harm in age 25+ ,Most countries are low with a few higher values led by Greenland. The range spans roughly 0.01 to 0.06,Maps show spatial clustering for risk probabilities,Self harm risk is low overall but concentrated in a few places,v0_gbd_probability_of_death_map.png,html/v0_gbd_probability_of_death_map.html,8
v0_gbd_probability_of_death_top20,Top 20 probability of death,GBD Probability of Death,Ranked bar,Rank countries by self harm probability of death for age 25+ ,Greenland is highest near 0.06 with a small group above 0.03. The top ranks are close which suggests a tight upper tier,Ranked bars emphasize leaders and gaps,A small set of countries dominates the top tier,v0_gbd_probability_of_death_top20.png,html/v0_gbd_probability_of_death_top20.html,9
v0_gbd_risk_factor_treemap,Risk factor burden composition,GBD Risk Factors,Treemap,Summarize the composition of risk factor burden,Substance and alcohol related blocks occupy the largest area and dwarf most other factors. Smaller categories such as tobacco and injuries contribute far less in this view,Treemaps show part to whole structure in limited space,Burden is concentrated in a small set of factors,v0_gbd_risk_factor_treemap.png,html/v0_gbd_risk_factor_treemap.html,10
v0_gbd_anemia_heatmap,Anemia YLDs rate by sex over time,GBD Anemia (YLDs),Heatmap,Track anemia YLD rates by sex across years,Female rates are consistently highest across years with male lowest and both in between. Year to year changes are modest with a slight downward drift for female after 2020,Heatmaps reveal patterns across time and category,Anemia burden changes over time and differs by sex,v0_gbd_anemia_heatmap.png,html/v0_gbd_anemia_heatmap.html,11
